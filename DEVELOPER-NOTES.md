## Project Structure

- `common` submodule contains shared code for all platforms.
    - It contains the interfaces and abstractions for
        - Permissions
        - Scheduling
        - Players
        - Blocks
        - Worlds/Levels
        - The Server
    - In addition to the interfaces, the code also contains the implementations for
        - Commands
            - Commands use incendio's `cloud` command system. All you have to do to add platform support is to create a
              CommandManager and call register().
        - Handling Events
        - Gathering Statistics
- `bukkit` contains bukkit-specific code

If you want to add support for a new platform, simply make a new submodule and implement the interfaces for.

- Scheduling Tasks
- Checking for Permissions
- Listening for events and calling the right handler
- Players + Blocks + World + Server
- Metrics

You will need to handle events when Players:

- join/leave
- are damaged
- take velocity (knock back)

If you find your platform is lacking events, take a look at how the PlayerVelocityEvent is implemented fabric for some
direction of what to do

## List of version and platform-specific caveats

- Runnable and manual ping does not work on fabric right now due b/c packetevents. Ping measurement will be less
  accurate
